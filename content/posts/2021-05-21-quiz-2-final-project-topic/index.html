<p>#Final Project Topic: Discipline and Rules in Schools</p>
<p>The Junior High and High School years are arguably the most important for a
young person as they determine the course of their future. One of the most
important parts of this experience is learning discipline in understanding
expectations and adhering to set rules and guidelines within the school they
are part of. Using past data from rules infractions, I would like to investigate
any patterns that we might see among students. For example, are there certain
guidelines they are struggling to follow and understand more than others? If so,
should the school or institution consider making any changes or adjustments to
these particular rules? Also of interest would be is there a particular grade
level that produces more infractions and what type of infractions are they? Does
gender play a role in behavior or is it random from year to year? These are
important questions for the development of students in order to provide the
most productive and growth stimulating environments.</p>
